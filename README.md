Architecture
•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
We used HTML, CSS and javascript on the projects frontend. HTML and CSS are relatively simple languages that create a skeleton for the website. Javascript is a more complex language that creates the actions of the website. Angular js was used in the SPA and it’s a more complex with the use of routes to help navigate the site and modules to help connect them dynamically.
•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
Because it’s a more robust  database and maintains its connection throughout the lifespan of the website.

Functionality
•	How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is different from javascript because it uses a bracketed syntax and lists the various attributes inline and JSON ties together the frontend and backend by providing a way for the two sides to communicate.
•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
When we switched to handlebars and refactored the code by splitting various “DIVS” up and including them all in the main site. Reusable components benefit you because of what their name implies, their reusable you can build a component, such as a navigation bar, and reuse it on several webpages without having to retype the code.

Testing
•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Methods are a form of OOP that allow you to build one subroutine and reuse it as needed, endpoints of an API are the points at which you reach the end of an application and no more data exists, security is a way to make sure the user is who they say they are and they have the correct permission to navigate the website.

Reflection
•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has helped me by teaching me javascript and reinforceing my HTML, CSS background. I think the full stack knowledge will help me become a more marketable candidate in my field.
